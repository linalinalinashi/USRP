If Ethernet LINK LED (Port 0 = 1 Gigabit Ethernet (1GbE)) does not illuminate:

Solutions:
- Ensure your USRP is powered on.
- If the green LINK LED does not illuminate in port 0, you should try a different (known working) SFP+ adapter.
- If a known good SFP+ adapter does not elicit a green LINK LED, you should attempt recovery using the HG image.

In my case, I use the Linux 16.04 + USRP X300 + Xilinx Vivado Lab Edition: 2015.4. 

Note: Flashing the FPGA image via JTAG only does not write the FPGA image to EEPROM,
must run the uhd_image_loader to write the FPGA image to the internal EEPROM.
To do that, using the command below:
uhd_image_loader --args "type=x300,addr=192.168.10.2,fpga=HG"
