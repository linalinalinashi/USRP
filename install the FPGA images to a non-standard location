If you have installed the images to a non-standard location, you might need to run (change the filename according to your device):

    uhd_image_loader --args="type=x300,addr=192.168.10.2" --fpga-path="<path_to_images>/usrp_x310_fpga_HG.bit"
The process of updating the FPGA image will take several minutes. Make sure the process of flashing the image does not get interrupted.
